# WoZ-Way Hello World

This project contains sample code for getting started sending messages back and
forth to the car using a Wizard control interface.

## Instructions
1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine. If you are on a Mac and
use Homebrew, you can use `brew install node`

2. Navigate to the **CONTROL** directory and run `npm install`

3. In the **CONTROL** directory, run `node server.js`

4. Navigate to the **CAR** directory and run `npm install`

5. In the **CAR** directory, run `node server.js`

On the computer that the CAR is running on, make sure that you are on a Mac. You
can set the default voice in you System Preference.

6. In a web browser navigate to `localhost:8000` - this is where the control
interface is. You should be able to see live data coming back from the car. You
should also be able to send messages using the message input for custom messages
of from the Common Questions area by clicking the buttons.
